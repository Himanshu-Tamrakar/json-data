		How effective is hand sanitizer in preventing disease? The answer may surprise you.
With the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, it's not surprising that many people are taking extra steps to stay safe, including stocking up on sanitizing sprays, gels and soaps. But are hand sanitizers the best defense against bacteria and viruses like coronavirus and influenza?
Companies that market these products (which are sometimes labeled "antibacterial" or "antimicrobial") say yes. But some consumer advocates say no, arguing that they aren't effective and have the potential to engender bacterial strains that resist antibiotics.
As it turns out, the best answer is to take a common-sense approach.
		How useful are hand sanitizers?
They're useful in the hospital, to help prevent the transfer of viruses and bacteria from one patient to another by hospital personnel. Beyond a hospital setting, it's very difficult to show that hand sanitizing products are useful.
Outside of the hospital most people catch respiratory viruses from direct contact with people who already have them, and hand sanitizers won't do anything in those circumstances. And they haven't been shown to have more disinfecting power than just washing your hands with soap and water.
		Are all hand sanitizers created equal?
It's important to make sure any hand sanitizer you do use contains at least 60 percent alcohol. 
Studies have found that sanitizers with lower concentrations or non-alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not as effective at killing germs as those with 60 to 95 percent alcohol.
In particular, non-alcohol-based sanitizers may not work equally well on different types of germs and could cause some germs to develop resistance to the sanitizer.
		When to avoid hand sanitizers?
You should always clean with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty, or if you've touched chemicals. 
When hands are heavily soiled or greasy — such as after playing outdoor sports or working at a construction site — the CDC cautions that hand sanitizers may not work well at all.
		Benefits of soap and water
Whenever you can, just wash your hands — for at least 20 seconds — with non-bacterial soap and warm water.
The CDC says soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers at removing certain types of germs. They also do a better job of preserving the flora, or "good" bacteria, on your hands.
Your whole body is covered with bacteria, and if you remove those good bacteria, they can be replaced by other, potentially harmful, bacteria. Natural bacteria are there for a reason.
		The best defense: cleanliness
What does your room look like? What does the bathroom look like? How about your phone? There's a good chance all of these things need to be cleaned. It's not necessary to use antimicrobial products: The important thing is to keep everything clean on a regular basis.
On the other hand, some people are concerned about hygiene to an extreme extent. We try to assure them that if they do the usual things like practicing good hygiene — rather than taking extraordinary measures — they'll be fine.
