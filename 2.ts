Talk about bad luck! The Corona beer logo has a crown on it. The word “corona” means “crown” in Spanish and Latin. Coincidentally, the coronavirus got its name from the crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus particles.
When some people first heard about the new virus, they were confused and may have associated it with the Corona beer brand. They may have even believed that the virus was spread by drinking the beer. It is unclear how much of an impact this mistaken belief has had on sales of the beer as various sources have reported different results.
According to YouGov, a British market research firm, Corona beer’s buzz score—a measure of the popularity of the brand—has dropped from 75 to 51 since the beginning of 2020.
