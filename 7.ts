		Our assessment:
Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 members of the public in cities around the world have taken to wearing the close fitting N95 masks to protect themselves. But will this help?
The surgeon General in the US has resorted to twitter to say “Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!” He continues to say that they are not effective in preventing the general public from catching COVID-19 but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk.
There is evidence that masks can help to reduce the risk of catching respiratory infections from those known to be carrying the virus. This includes healthcare workers and members of the public caring for individuals who have COVID-19. Masks are recommended for these groups and also for people with respiratory symptoms or who are suspected of having COVID-19, to protect others. Masks need to be used and disposed of correctly to work.
N95 Masks are not recommended for other healthy members of the general public, partly because of the need to be changed regularly and the close fit required. Regular hand washing and not touching mouth, nose, or eyes with unclean hands, are more important measures for the general public to take.

		Where did the story come from?
Public mask wearing during outbreaks of respiratory illness has been happening for a while, so no one source is responsible.
Certain media stories, like this one from a news outlet in Houston Texas are fuelling purchases with the headline “Local doctor says this mask prevents the spread of coronavirus, but it’s selling out fast”.

		What is the basis for the claim?
A Cochrane systematic review (a study which collects all of the relevant information about a research question) from 2011 found that surgical masks or N95 respirators can reduce the spread of respiratory viruses, such as SARS (another type of coronavirus). N95 respirators are more advanced protective devices that give a very close facial fit and can filter out more than normal face masks. Much of the available evidence comes from healthcare workers or others in close contact with an infected person.
The evidence available at that time suggested that normal surgical masks were no less effective than N95 respirators, which can be uncomfortable to wear, irritate the skin, and cost more. This led the review authors to suggest they may be useful in high risk situations only.

		What do trusted sources say?
The WHO recommends that if you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person who is suspected of having a COVID-19 infection to protect yourself.
Importantly, the WHO stress that if masks are used, they need to be worn and disposed of properly, and combined with good hand hygiene in order to work.
In the US, the panic buying of masks has led to increasing prices, and concerns about shortages of masks for healthcare professionals.
